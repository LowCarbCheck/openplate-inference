/**
 * The last line of defence for the privacy promise: a scrubber every string that

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS EVEN THOUGH NO CALL SITE LOGS AN IMAGE. Our own call sites are
 * disciplined — `logger.ts`'s field type will not even accept a Buffer. The gap
 * is somebody ELSE's string: a dependency that helpfully includes the input it
 * choked on in its `Error.message`, a validation library that quotes the
 * offending value, a future contributor who adds one `${error}`. On the happy
 * path none of that fires, which is precisely why the happy path passing proves
 * nothing.
 *
 * So: scrub at the boundary, and let `tests/unit/no-image-in-error-paths.test.ts`
 * prove it by throwing an error that DOES carry the base64 and asserting the
 * bytes appear in neither the log lines nor the response body.
