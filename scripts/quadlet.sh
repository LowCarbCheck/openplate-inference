# The quadlet units under docker/quadlet/ are GENERATED from the compose files
# by podlet (github.com/containers/podlet). Nobody edits them by hand: this
# script writes them, and the pre-push hook regenerates them and fails the push
# the moment the committed copy differs from a fresh run. M231 spec 02.
#
#   scripts/quadlet.sh generate            rewrite docker/quadlet/<scenario>/ for every scenario (README.md is kept)
#   scripts/quadlet.sh check               regenerate into a temp dir, diff against the committed copy
#   scripts/quadlet.sh check --self-test-drift
#                                          prove the check CAN fail: plant a wrong unit, expect drift
#   scripts/quadlet.sh --install <dir>     download the pinned podlet release into <dir> (for a CI runner)
#
# WHAT THE TRANSFORM DOES, and why each step exists. podlet reads plain compose
# YAML and refuses the parts of it that have no quadlet equivalent, so a small
# stdlib-only Python pass rewrites each file before podlet sees it:
#
#   * `${VAR:-default}` and `${VAR-default}` become `default`. podlet does not
#     interpolate, and systemd does not expand `${VAR}` inside Environment=,
#     so a literal would reach the container as the string "${VAR}".
#   * `${VAR:?message}` (a value the operator MUST supply) is dropped from
#     `environment:` and the service gains `env_file: <project>.env`, which
#     podlet turns into `EnvironmentFile=<project>.env`. Quadlet resolves that
#     path against the unit directory and refuses to start without the file,
#     which is the same "set it or nothing starts" contract compose enforces.
#   * `depends_on: { x: { condition: service_healthy } }` becomes the short
#     list form, which podlet accepts and turns into After= and Requires=. The
#     health wait comes back as `Notify=healthy` on every unit whose compose
#     service DECLARES a healthcheck: systemd then holds the dependants until
#     the check passes. Such a unit also gets `TimeoutStartSec=300`: the user
#     manager's default is 45 seconds on Fedora, and a first boot of Postgres
#     (initdb, two fsync rounds) took 40 of them on a laptop, so the health
#     check never reported before systemd killed the container and every unit
#     that Requires= it failed for good (M231 spec 03). Image-baked
#     healthchecks are deliberately left alone; openplate-inference's has a 60
#     minute start period, and Notify=healthy on it would wait for the whole
#     weight download.
#   * `build:` is dropped and a commented `# image:` directly below it is
#     uncommented. The units run the published image; podlet cannot build.
#   * every service joins one named network, called after the compose
#     `name:`, with its service name as a network alias. Compose does both
#     implicitly (the `<project>_default` network, and the service name as a
#     DNS alias) and that is what lets `sync` reach `postgres` by hostname.
#     A bare quadlet unit with no Network= lands on the default bridge, which
#     has no DNS, and one without the alias is only reachable as
#     `systemd-postgres`, the container name Quadlet picks (M231 spec 03).
#
# Every unit starts with a header naming its source compose file and the
# podlet version, so a reader knows where a change has to be made. The output
# is byte-deterministic: podlet sorts its keys, and the transform is pure.
